# SVDRP gem #

SVDRP gem is a Simple VDR Protocol implementation for Ruby
VDR (http://www.tvdr.de/)

## Usage ##

All functionality is contained in the SVDRP class. Creating an instance of this
class is as simple as

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'svdrp'

    svdrp = SVDRP.new 'vdr_host_name', 2001

Once you have an instance of the VDR class, start by connecting to the server:

    svdrp.connect

When you are done, disconnect by calling disconnect

    svdrp.disconnect

Once connected, you can issue commands to talk to the server

    svdrp.connect
    svdrp.channel = 1
    channel = svdrp.channel
    puts "Current Channel: #{channel.number} #{channel.name}"
